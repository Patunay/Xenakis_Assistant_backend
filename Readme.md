## Introduction:

Xenakis_Assistant_backend (XAb) is a data backend that organizes the musical information that will be used for computer-generated and computer-assisted composition utilities that will be featured in the Xenakis software.

Xenakis_Assistant_backend organizes (or creates depending on mode) musical information using formal arrangment analysis as the main classifier factor.

Xenakis_Assistant_backend supports unlimited levels of abstraction when organizing musical information.

### **Data organization architecture** _and its relevant parameters_:

- _up to N times._

### Parameter merging

XAb calculates inner parameters based on the related parameter belonging to the estructural abstraction directly over itself.
For example:

- XAb want to calculate Delta values for a Section belonging to a 3 section set that conform a Macro-section that has a Delta value of 0.34
- After either the user or XAb itself sets the Delta value for the first section, possible values for the remaining 2 will be calculated, assesesed agaist other guesses, and display as suggested values.
- The values guesses are calculated by calculating diverse values that if averaged (with the values of the other 2 sections conforming the Macro-section, will give the, or an aproximation of the Delta value for the Macro-section)
- Further explanation:
  - Macro-section "A" Delta Value: 0.34
  - Number of Sections in Macro-section "A": 3
  - Name of each Section inside Macro-section "A": "a", "b", "c"
  - if Delta of "a" = 0.5
    - Possible remaining delta values for "b" and "c" sections:
      - b = 0.3, c = 0.22 | Average = 0.34 (taking into account "a" = 0.5)
      - b = 0.13, c = 0.39 | Average = 0.34 (taking into account "a" = 0.5)
    - As long as the addition of Deltas of "b" and "c" is 0.52, any values would work.
    - No negative numbers allowed. Range [0.0 to 1.0]
- This particular data structure allows XAb to make predictions based on parameter values of structural elements above it and the elements at the same structural level.

### Usage

Currently, There are 2 possible uses for XAb:

- Implementation of Computer Assisted Composition Tools and Real time composition Assistants
  - After a algorithm (that has not been created yet) audits the XAb data of a piece of music in the process of being created, it can suggest a diverse arrange of ideas like:
    - Dynamic suggestions.
    - Instrumentation suggestions.
    - Contrapuntal suggestions.
    - Texturization suggestions.
    - GLOBAL MASTERIZATION OF THE MUSIC
      - Gives a choice for the composer to "Idealize/Perfect/Polish" the composition based on XAb analysis.
        - Harmonic suggestions
        - Proportionality suggestions
        - Contrapuntal suggestions
        - Orchestration suggestions
        - Dynamic suggestions
      - All this to strive to achieve the best possible piece every time.
  - All this based on the parameters inside each structural element.
  - Real time composition assistants would add quality-of-life improvements in the composition process:
    - Auto-merge layers
    - Creation of reductions
    - Harmonic suggestions
    - GUI ASSISTANT:
      - I envision Xenakis providing a special GUI when composing.
      - This GUI will show data such as:
        - Remaining time for current section
        - Transition timing
        - Overal timing suggestions (based on golden proportions or a user defined rule)
        - Color coding macro-sections.
          - As semitransparent overlay.
        - Show pending tasks:
          - Finish x section
          - Work on y transition
          - Revise proportions of a particular structural element
  - XAb also opens the path for creating the best virtual assistant for any given composer using machine learning.
    - The virtual assistant will learn from the user and will taylor the suggestions based on collected data.
- Serve as a data backend that a artificial intelligence will use to conceptualize and create brand new pieces of music using structural organization hierachies.
  - Computer generated composition based on random parameter input.
  - Diverse levels possible thanks to structural elements conforming a given piece.
    - Can either generate:
      - Whole Piece
      - Couple of Macro-sections
      - All sections
      - Etc...
